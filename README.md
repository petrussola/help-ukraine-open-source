# List of open source projects aimed at helping Ukraine and Ukrainians during this conflict

#### I am selecting the ones that have at least a reasonable web or product working in production and straightforward enough that I could explain to my grandma. I see projects related to blockchain and cyberwarfare. I am staying clear of these repos for the simple reason that I don't understand what's going on inside. These are the ones I have found so far, please add more to the list if you find them 🙏
